## About

Algorithm to determine parallel passages in the Hebrew Bible.

Part of the
[SYNVAR](https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/research-projects/i/30/9930.html)
project carried out at the 
[ETCBC](http://etcbc.nl)

## Results

The results of this study are being delivered in several forms, summarized here.

* **Case study**: a 
  [case study](https://github.com/ETCBC/parallels/blob/master/programs/kings_ii.ipynb)
  showing the parallels involved in 2 Kings 19-26; 
* **Annotations**: a set of
  [annotations](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/hebrew/note?version=4b&id=Mnxjcm9zc3JlZg__&tp=txt_tb1&nget=v)
  in **SHEBANQ** showing the parallels as clickable cross-references;
* **Data module**: a set of 
  [higher level features](https://github.com/ETCBC/parallels/tree/master/tf)
  in **text-fabric** format, storing the cross-references as features;
* **Documentation**: a
  [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/etcbc/parallels/blob/master/programs/parallels.ipynb)
* **Program code**: a
  [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ETCBC/parallels/tree/master/programs)
  Codes the algorithm and applies it using many different
  parameter settings.
